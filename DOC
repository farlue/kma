Basic buddy:

  1. We found that the time cost of updating the bitmap is crucial to the total performance, so we specifically optimized this function, using pre-set masks and memset().
  2. To minimize the number of pages that are occupied simultaneously, and thus increase space efficiency, pages are freed once they are empty.
  3. The free lists are doubly linked lists, which enables fast insertion and removal.
  4. To round up a requested malloc size fast, our get_roundup() function uses mostly bit operation.

Lazy buddy:

  1. Lazy buddy is faster than basic buddy, since it updates bitmap less frequently and coalesces only when necessary.
  2. Lazy buddy puts delayed buffers in the front of free lists, therefore a delayed buddy buffer can be found quickly for accelerated coalescing.
